An intelligent machine learning system that predicts possible diseases based on patient-reported symptoms and provides confidence-based results to assist in early medical decision-making.

📌 Project Overview

This project uses supervised machine learning to analyze symptom patterns and predict diseases.
It implements and compares multiple models to ensure accuracy, reliability, and robustness.

The complete ML pipeline — from data preprocessing to evaluation and user prediction — is demonstrated using Python in Google Colab.
